# Convolutional neural network on isic2024 data set

In this folder I coded a CNN on the isic2024 dataset using python to practice my knowlege of neural networks. The isic2024 dataset can be found on this [Website](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/data). You only have to download the train-metadata.csv and the train-image.hdf5 and place them into the same folder as the cnn.py. The code is preset to 45 epochs and 5000 negative samples to give a good training experience to the neural network and to cover all cancer cases. The negative data is reduced to 5000 because of the highly unbalanced dataset (~400k negative samples and ~390 positive) and then divided into training and test data at a ratio of 80/20. The network uses a weighted focalloss function in combination with class weighted samples and a cosine annealing learning rate to deal with the high unbalance in the dataset. Most parameter can be edited directly at the top of the code and a DEBUG option is given to get the class counts for both characteristics printed out for the full and the reduced dataset. The model prints current epoch, loss, learning rate and runtime of the epoch while training and gives a classification report as overview at the end
