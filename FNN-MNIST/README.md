#Feedforward neural network on mnist data set

In this folder I coded a FNN on the mnist data set using python to practice my knowlege of neural networks. The mnist data set for training and testing is provided in this folder as a zip file because of it's size and needs to be extracted into the same folder as the FNN.py file. The code prints the performance as a percentage as well as the correct samples of the test set to the total number of samples.
